Usage:
======
shapeshifter.py shapefile.dbf country_code level[1|2] <xls|csv|json> <outfile>

The level indocates wheather the shapfile you are reading is statelevel (i.e.
subdivision / level 1) or county level (i.e. level 2).

The output format options are "xls" for Excel, "csv" for comma seperated value
(we use pipes instead of commas), or json for json output.

The outfile is the name of the file the output is written.  If not specified,
the file name out.[json|csv|xls] is used.

If you do not specify an output format (or file), then the result is dumped to
stdout in json.

An example converting a state(level 1) shapefile to a CSV file
::
    $ python shapeshifter.py nigeria_states.dbf NG 1 csv nigeria_states.csv

An example converting a county(level 2) shapefile to a JSON file
::
    $ python shapeshifter.py nigeria_lev2.dbf NG 2 json nigeria_lev2.json
