* pycurl
* shapely

Installation:
=============

	$ cd python-shapeshifer
	$ (sudo) python setup.py installl

Usage:
======

This is the basic usage of the command line utility.
::
$shapeshift [shapefile] [country_code] [level[0|1|2] <xls|csv|json> <outfile>

Note that you pass the shapefile name with a file extension.  There should be at
least two file with the same name and extensions .dbf and .shp in the same
directory. 

The level indicates wheather the shapfile you are reading is country level (level 0),
statelevel (i.e.subdivision / level 1) or county level (i.e. level 2).

The output format options are "xls" for Excel, "csv" for comma seperated value
(we use pipes instead of commas), or json for json output.

The outfile is the name of the file the output is written.  If not specified,
the file name out.[json|csv|xls] is used.

If you do not specify an output format (or file), then the result is dumped to
stdout in json.

An example converting a state(level 1) shapefile to a CSV file
::
    $ shapeshift nigeria_country_boundary NG 1 csv nigeria_states.csv


An example converting a state(level 1) shapefile to a CSV file
::
    $ shapeshifter nigeria_states NG 1 csv nigeria_states.csv

An example converting a county(level 2) shapefile to a JSON file
::
    $ shapeshift nigeria_lev2 NG 2 json nigeria_lev2.json
